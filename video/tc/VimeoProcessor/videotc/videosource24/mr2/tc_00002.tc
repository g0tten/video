  <videos Title="Off Book: Video Games" Description="Video games are more important than they seem. They are a storytelling medium, a place for self-expression.  The age-old tradition of gaming teaches us strategy, maneuvering, and the importance of making choices. From the cinematic experiences of mainstream gaming, to the hyper-personal environments of indie games, gaming activity defines the way we live and interact with information, and each other.&#xA;&#xA;Featuring:&#xA;&#xA;Eric Zimmerman, Game Designer&#xA;Jesper Juul, Game Studies Scholar&#xA;Leigh Alexander, Game Journalist&#xA;Syed Salahuddin, Game Designer and Curator&#xA;&#xA;Music by:&#xA;&#xA;4mat, http://freemusicarchive.org/music/4mat/&#xA;The Shortsleeves, http://theshortsleeves.bandcamp.com/&#xA;Trash80, http://trash80.net/&#xA;&#xA;Follow Off Book:&#xA;&#xA;Twitter: @pbsoffbook&#xA;Tumblr: http://pbsarts.tumblr.com/&#xA;&#xA;Produced by Kornhaber Brown: http://www.kornhaberbrown.com" Id="5d4ed55ff6bb740da03347872a28c86d945edd93"/>
  <videos Title="LIVE FAST, DRAW YUNG" Description="The story of Yung Lenox: Rap's most prolific (7-year-old) portraitist.&#xA;&#xA;Described by LA Weekly as the 'Foremost Doodler of Rap', this hilariously endearing film follows Seattle's 7-year-old rap portraitist, Yung Lenox, and his Dad, Skip - an unconventional artistic duo simultaneously navigating the tumultuous worlds of rap and modern-day-parenting. Through Lenox's eyes, ears and encounters with rappers such as Kool Keith and Cam'ron, the film presents an innocent entry point into the idolized and often explicit world of hip hop. It reconsiders the age-old parental advisory debate and the realities of a kid growing up in an adult world. As Skip confronts criticism about his intentions and parenting, Lenox remains unfazed. In his world, art is 'medium important' compared to school, Lego's and Minecraft. And that's why the kid is everyone's favorite artist.&#xA;&#xA;Directed by Stacey Lee &amp; Anthony Mathile&#xA;DP: Jacob Rosen&#xA;Producer: Stacey Lee&#xA;Associate Producers: Corbett Jones, Anna Rau, Jacob Rosen, Marina Cukeric&#xA;Additional Camera: Frank Mobilio&#xA;Editor: Anthony Mathile, Matthew Charof&#xA;Supervising Editor: Joe Peeler&#xA;Music Composition: Aaron Stein-Chester&#xA;Audio Post Production: One Thousand Birds&#xA;Sound Editing / Mixing: Andrew Tracy, Calvin Hunting Pia&#xA;Colorist: Matt Conrad&#xA;Stills Photography: Brook Fetch, Jordan Nicholson, Skip Class&#xA;Title Design: Nicci Martinez, Hannah Souter&#xA;Poster Design: Jon Santos&#xA;&#xA;Special Thanks: Carmody Brothers, Spencer Breen, Erik Perry, British Young, Lee Gibson, Karie Higgins, Andrew Gurguis, From the Range Films&#xA;&#xA;Starring: Yung Lenox, Skip Buringrad, Megan Bingham, Cam'ron &amp; Kool Keith" Id="129bc0312b1e1ee78a53891f1360e773acc69555"/>

  <videos Title="Clouds in Cloudless Skies" Description="A music video made out of random, procedurally generated worlds and landscapes created entirely from programming code.  A collaboration, or perhaps, a collision - an accident waiting to happen between two unconventional artists Glenn Marshall (animator / programmer) and Hello Moth (singer / songwriter).&#xA;&#xA;Featured in The Creators Project with interviews and article&#xA;http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/premiere-dive-into-the-clouds-in-this-code-generated-music-video&#xA;&#xA;This was a process of discovering, creating and exploring random worlds through code and numbers, tweaking, playing, running the program, to see what is created.  It might reveal a world or a landscape that fits with a particular part of the song - with the lyrics, the pace etc, - a continual journey through the randomly generated and how it connects literally, metaphorically or emotionally to the song.  &#xA;&#xA;The world generation algorithms mainly depend on 3D perlin noise - this is a basic cloud like random generator - but when mixed with other algorithms, complex and exciting results can happen.&#xA;&#xA;The visual rendering system is based on the 'Distance Estimation / Ray Marching' technique normally used to render 3D fractals, but here used to create cube and grid worlds.  There are no wireframes or meshes involved - no timelines, keyframes or fancy user interfaces - everything is expressed as math and formula in lines of code, including all the animation and distortion effects (often synced to the music's BPM) and all the camera movement. &#xA;&#xA;The result is 'Clouds in Cloudless Skies' - Bladerunner meets Koyaanisqatsi meets Minecraft.  An ambitious, passionate exploration of random infinite beauty through the art of computer programming.&#xA;&#xA;Made with the Processing programming language.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Glenn Marshall&#xA;www.butterfly.ie&#xA;&#xA;Hello Moth&#xA;http://www.hellomoth.com&#xA;&#xA;(download the song here)&#xA;Bandcamp: http://bit.ly/1uxnUVd&#xA;iTunes: http://bit.ly/1k32GKv" Id="9df6ba13a0a2afe400b44280a8f94ad7747468b9"/>

  <videos Title="Minecraft: The Story of Mojang (20min Proof of Concept for Feature Length)" Description="To learn more about how you can help finance the production of a feature-length film to continue the story, please visit our Kickstarter campaign: http://www.tinyurl.com/minecraftdoc&#xA;&#xb7;&#xb7;&#xb7;&#xb7;&#xb7;&#xA;Over the past year, the computer game Minecraft has become a cultural phenomenon, drawing millions of players into the unique, low-res world created solely by Swedish programmer Markus &quot;Notch&quot; Persson.  When Persson announced that he would invest his Minecraft earnings in founding his own development house, Mojang, 2 Player Productions seized upon the rare opportunity to fly to Stockholm and document the first week in the life of the new studio.&#xA;&#xA;During the editing process of what was only supposed to be a twenty-minute short, it became clear that an important chapter of gaming history was still being written, and that a feature-length documentary about Mojang's first year would make a powerful statement about what it means to create, release, and play games in the twenty-first century.&#xA;&#xA;For the first time, viewers will be given an in-depth look at both the triumphs and the challenges faced by a studio during their first year in existence.  2 Player will analyze the unprecedented success of Minecraft, gain insight into its impact from journalists and industry professionals, and meet the fans whose lives have been changed by the game.&#xA;&#xA;Using the short as a proof-of-concept, 2 Player is turning to the revolutionary fundraising site Kickstarter.com to completely finance the film's production over the course of the next year. By sourcing the budget from the game's immense fanbase, it empowers the consumer to vote for content they want with their wallets and fosters a more direct relationship between themselves and the final product.&#xA;&#xA;http://2playerproductions.com/projects/minecraft" Id="80c0a06b7dbf0fdd7485241659eb173c5196ddc0"/>
