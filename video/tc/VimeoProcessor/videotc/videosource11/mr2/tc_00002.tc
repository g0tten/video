  <videos Title="Instravel - A Photogenic Mass Tourism Experience" Description="&#x25ba; Editing:&#xA;facebook.com/Oliver-KMIA-1622032868057530&#xA;instagram.com/oliverkmia/&#xA;twitter.com/OliverKMIA&#xA;&#xA;&#x266b; Music: Ben Laver&#xA;benlaver.com&#xA;https://soundcloud.com/ben-laver/instravel-a-photogenic-mass-tourism-experience-soundtrack&#xA;&#xA;&#x25ba; Copyright and Picture Removal Request &#xA;Regarding copyright, this work falls under fair use due to the short duration of each image appearance (1/7 of a second) and the &quot;transformative&quot; nature of this project.

Thanks.&#xA;&#xA;&#x25ba; Concept:&#xA;I explained all the details of the video in this article at: https://fstoppers.com/bts/how-i-created-viral-video-and-what-i-learned-process-218052&#xA;&#xA;I came up with this idea last year while traveling in Roma. I wanted to take a look at the popular Trevi Fountain but I never managed to get close to it. The place was assaulted by hundreds of tourists, some of them formed a huge line to get a spot in front of the Fountain. Needless to say that I was very pissed by this sight and left for the not less crowded Pantheon.&#xA;I was shocked by the mass of people walking all around the city, yet I was one of them, not better or worst. Like all these tourists, I burned hundred of gallons of fuel to get there, rushed to visit the city in a few days and stayed in a hotel downtown. Then, I remembered a video I watched a few months earlier from the artist Hi&#xe9;rophante (vimeo.com/151297208). I decided to make this kind of sarcastic video but with the focus on travel and mass tourism. Hi&#xe9;rophante admitted that his video was &quot;clich&#xe9;&quot; and that he got inspired by other videos. So I'm basically making fun of something I'm part of. The irony is strong.&#xA;&#xA;While the era of mass world tourism and global world travel opened up in the 60s and 70s with the development of Jumbo Jets and low cost airlines, there is a new trend that consists of taking pictures everywhere you go to share it on social networks. During my trip, I felt that many people didn't really enjoy the moment and were hooked to their smartphones. As if the ultimate goal of travel was to brag about it online and run after the likes and followers.&#xA;In a recent article published by the Guardian, journalist Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett described this phenomena:&#xA;&quot;These Instagrammers are collectively sucking the joy and spontaneity out of travel photography, and for those unfortunate enough to bump into them abroad, possibly travel itself. We must pity the poor locals, who have to put up with them. [...] Social media encourages the memeification of human experience. Instead of diversity we see homogeneity. It&#x2019;s extremely boring.&quot;&#xA;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/17/instagrammers-travel-sri-lanka-tourists-peachy-backsides-social-media-obsessed&#xA;In the extreme situation, this image rush can have negative impact on the environment&#xA;https://www.dpreview.com/news/3305755990/tourists-are-destroying-new-zealand-s-iconic-lake-wanaka-tree-for-instagram-photos&#xA;&#xA;However, I was able to find plenty of nice accounts over my research on Instagram. Some of them were inspiring and lead by talented persons. In the end, social networks are just a tool. For better or worse, (or both).&#xA;Eventually, I couldn't secure a picture of the Trevi Fountain for my Instragram account but I still had a very nice time in Italy. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x25ba; Production:&#xA;I used images available on public Instagram accounts. Finding and sorting the material took a lot of time but I produced the video over several months when I had time. The process of aligning each and every images manually in relation to the next was very tedious. &#xA;&#xA;Image credit of the video Thumbnail:&#xA;Eiffeil Tower: Pixabay&#xA;Lady with Iphone: Stokpic&#xA;Lady on the beach: Wendy Hero&#xA;Selfie: Tookapic&#xA;Japanese temple: Pixabay&#xA;Map: Pixabay&#xA;Taken from https://www.pexels.com/ (Creative Commons Zero CC0 license)" Id="ed8cce7160cda6bb8807adbaf2c725e6f0ed0788"/>

  <videos Title="Because clicking is so 90s!" Description="&quot;Because clicking is so 90s&quot; challenges user interaction online: It is the first website which can be controlled only with motion and voice.&#xA;&#xA;The evolution of input devices for machines and computers reveals: mouse and keyboard are only a temporary status quo for human machine interaction (HMI). The web application &quot;Because clicking is so 90s&quot; now pushes this development along for an experimental online use. The trend for using native and intuitive navigation systems &#x2014; which has become more and more important for the offline world (e. g. Multitouch, Project Natal) &#x2014; is now transferred to the online world.&#xA;&#xA;The goal of this web application is to avoid the use of keyboard and / or mouse &#x2014; in fact inadequate bridges for true HMI (man communication = machine communication) &#x2014; to introduce an alternative way for navigation with native human methods such as gestures, motion and voice. Of course, not all previous navigation methods can be adapted one-to-one or even applied at all. For this reason, this work evaluates and suggests a new type for navigation with adapted movement, voice and operating concepts and a further developed user experience.&#xA;&#xA;These advanced options with the so called &quot;audio-visual navigation&quot; are exemplary presented with a portfolio website. Beside contents for presenting and interacting with media assets, there are also special applications like an interactive music instrument (the so-called &#x201e;Play&quot;) or an intuitively rotatable and zoomable 3D object. Thus, this project creates a new awareness for alternative navigation methods, it also provides meaningful, elegant and exploratory applications." Id="b3f18ae6b918f79b159fb3f03ac451c150417f16"/>

  <videos Title="NEVER SATISFIED: The rent is too damn high." Description="WINNER - Gizmodo Time-lapse Challenge - 2011&#xA;&#xA;I have explored the idea of shooting time-lapse with a long time friend and talented artist who operates under the alias of NEVER (aka Never Satisfied) in Atlanta, Georgia. Never has been out of commission recently due to knee surgery followed by a nasty staph infection. While only partially recovered, he agreed to shoot for the time-lapse challenge. The artwork is titled &quot;The rent is too damn high&quot; and features a begging owl with droopy, drug induced eyes (prescribed pain killers). The inspiration for this creature came as a result of Never being in so much suffering due to his knee surgery along with his recent apartment hunting in NYC where he will be relocating later this month.&#xA;&#xA;To complete the challenge, I built a team consisting of my business partner and co-founder @ UpThink, Erik Huber, along with fellow photographer Jeremy Stephenson. Michael Wynne generously volunteered his time to create an original piece of music for the project. Once we had the man power, all we needed was a safe location to capture Never. We picked a location in NW Atlanta at an abandoned warehouse that's far off the grid. This spot has been a favorite of mine in recent years due to mysterious tire dumpers filling the space. It's an environmental disappointment to know that all this rubber is being dumped by someone and I personally do not condone those activities. However, the vast sea of tires offered us a unique visual perspective for this project. To help portray the passing time during the day via visible light beams, we hiked into the location with a 1k generator and hazer. The visible light created by the hazer combined with the constantly changing wind flow through the space really brought the location to life. We shot bracketed RAW exposures, but steered away from using any HDRs in the final video in an effort to not get caught up in the overly tone-mapped trend amongst photographers these days. The bracketed exposures allowed us more freedom in post to create some variation within the edit. We shot with longer exposures (4-13 seconds) to emphasize the movement with motion blur. This side-project was a lot of fun for everyone involved. We did have a few technical issues during the shoot-- such as getting our gas can (full of gas) stolen, the generator flooded mid-shoot, the 12v battery used with the Dynamic Perception dolly rig failed, and we ran out of light just as the artwork was being finished. Despite the minimal complications, we managed to finish the 45 second edit* and get it posted. - Doug Urquhart&#xA;&#xA;Produced by The UpThink Lab for the 2011 Gizmodo Time-lapse Video Challenge&#xA;&#xA;Photography by Doug Urquhart, Erik Huber, &amp; Jeremy Stephenson&#xA;&#xA;Artwork by MISTER NEVER SATISFIED&#xA;&#xA;Original Music titled &quot;Beautiful Mourning&quot; created by Michael Wynne&#xA;&#xA;Shot on a handful of Canon D-SLRs (5D MII, 7D, 5D, 400D)&#xA;Moco moves made possible with the Dynamic Perception dolly + TeleTrack pan/tilt head&#xA;Special thanks to PC&amp;E Atlanta&#xA;&#xA;*Keep an eye out for an extended edit on the UpThink Vimeo page within the coming days.

  <videos Title="real-time face generator / kagami" Description="kagami / Real-Time Face Generator&#xA;&#xA;&#x2018;kagami&#x2019; means a mirror in Japanese. &#x2018;kagami / Real-Time Face Generator&#x2019; is an installation, which features &#x2018;3D mirror,&#x2019; capable of replicating a person&#x2019;s face in three dimensions.&#xA;The installation&#x2019;s face scanner scans a participant&#x2019;s face, and a computer converts the scan into 3D modeling data. On the basis of this data, around 5,000 rods are moved forward by a motor, creating a 3D face in real time. The face then becomes a canvass for the theme of &#x2018;Kacho Fugetsu&#x2019;, which means beauties of nature in Japanese, as electric makeup art featuring morning glory, bamboo, butterflies, kingfishers, ibis, sunsets, cherry blossoms, moon etc. is projected onto its surface.&#xA;This work is the result of a collaboration between WOW and a project team from Kao Corporation, who drew their inspiration from the &#x2018;OMOTE&#x2019; project. It took one year to produce, from planning through to completion. It has been established as an exhibit at Kao&#x2019;s COCOLAB museum, founded in September this year.&#xA;Nobumichi Asai (WOW) acted as creative and technical director for &#x2018;kagami&#x2019; and &#x2018;Kacho Fugetsu,&#x2019; overseeing the planning and development of the project. Noboru Tomizawa, who also collaborated on &#x2018;Connected Colors&#x2019;, oversaw the makeup art. Beautiful makeup art provides a base over which WOW&#x2019;s CG animation is projected to evoke the vivacity and motion of nature. Music was provided by hatis noit, using a tonal palette exclusively composed of sounds from nature. Using sounds from her native Hokkaido, the sound of the wind over the plains, running water, bird song etc., hatis noit creates a sound-scape drawn from her own memories.&#xA;&#xA;Digital fabrication has been predominant around the world as the popularity of 3D printers represents. This work can be included in the trend. The definitions of &#x2018;thing&#x2019; and &#x2018;information&#x2019; are basically opposite, but they are equivalent in our mind in the age of digital fabrication. In a way, we can say our &#x2018;existence&#x2019; is composed of &#x2018;collection of meaningful information (= code)&#x2019;. In the human body, a spherule called a ribosome reads the sequence of DNA and transfers 20 different amino acids to produce protein. In the past, we thought that human lives were analogue and organic, which was different to the idea of digital computing. But human lives are supported by the idea like 3D printing in its essence. Cloning is done by copying DNA. And this idea expands to ethical issues with artificial cloning of organisms, which are still controversial. Experiencing this installation, you may be shocked. You should be one of a kind, but your &#x2018;existence&#x2019; is reproduced with this.

  <videos Title="Maluku Flying Frog" Description="Matz Ginman-Trout takes a 5'10 Flying Frog for a spin in some average UK waves.&#xA;&#xA;Find out more about the Flying Frog on line here: http://bit.ly/1lVgwy9&#xA;&#xA;About the Flying Frog:&#xA;&#xA;It's every surfers dilemma, particularly when the waves are small or weak: You want to get in the water, you want to catch waves, you need the board to help you generate speed BUT you still want to be able to lay it on a rail and throw a little spray.&#xA;&#xA;The trend for super fat shortboards has created a lot of fun shapes for surfers of all levels, but unless you're a WCT contender their fat tails can be hard to control properly rail to rail once you do get the board moving. The Maluku Flying Frog solves this problem by creating something of cut and shut; The front end is similar to a traditional egg or even minimal, but the tail is all rounded pin shortboard. You paddle in early and easy on that reassuring front end foam, pump through on your front foot on that wide, stable middle section and when you're ready weight the back foot and put the board on rail exactly as you would with a shortboard - the rounded pin tail gives control through the turn in gutless waves or hold AND control in larger surf.&#xA;&#xA;As a result the board lends itself perfectly to the surfer starting out and looking for an easy route to a decent shortboard surfing style, perhaps before stepping down to a proper shortboard - or the shortboarder looking to keep their rail work tight on days without enough grunt for their standard stick&#xA;&#xA;Dimensions&#xA;&#xA;5ft10 - 7'10 - Centre fin &amp; Quad setup&#xA;&#xA;Surfer: Matz Ginman-Trout&#xA;Music: Sugar Minott - Give the People What They Want" Id="e548e4d05bd2b72c515652d18aeee3b59b6ce7a4"/>
