Everything you need to know! - Luke Zelon at The SEA Homeschoolers Conference: June 2022" Description="Pro gamers are the new celebrities and it&#x2019;s likely your child wants to play video games for a living when they grow up. But what can you do right now to put them in the best position to achieve this goal? What college scholarship opportunities are available for competitive gamers and those that want to study gaming related courses? We&#x2019;ll chat all things gaming, esports, and making sure you - and your child - are prepared for the future of gaming.&#xA;&#xA;Luke Zelon is the founder of NXT UP Esports. Luke's experience covers the highest levels of esports, gaming, and traditional sports. He&#x2019;s worked at TSM, the largest esports team in the world, LAFC (MLS soccer club), and various sports agencies. Luke graduated from Harvard University where he studied sociology and played on the football team all four years. While working at TSM, the largest esports team in the world, it became apparent that the way kids are introduced to video games is completely opposite of the way he was introduced to traditional sports. His experience playing all levels of amateur sports gives him a unique advantage in developing the next evolution of the youth gaming experience." Id="428e8d31cd79288242357e2770c98677ddc95d0e"/>
