  <videos Title="John (or is it Simon?) Kelly's Birthday" Description="A family gathering to celebrate his 70th.&#xA;&#xA;When I first found out about this evening, I was definitely happy. I was happy that I'd have the opportunity embarrass my brother, send him up rotten, tell lots of  embarrassing tales about him in front of a large audience. So you can imagine my disappointment when I sat down to write this, and I couldn't think of any way to badmouth him effectively. It's funny how your mind and memories can betray you when you really need them the most. Of course, I can't stand up here and say all sorts of good things about this fella... that&#x2019;s ubnthinkable he is my brother, after all.&#xA;&#xA;So I thought maybe I'd talk about being seventy but then I realized, &quot;how the heck am I gonna write about being seventy? I don&#x2019;t even know what its like being sixty five&#x2026;!!&quot; So that brought me back to bad mouthing him, and though I could stand up here and tell you about how there was this Polish woman in London., once &#x2026; no no, that was me&#x2026;..,   I think if I just related a string of incidents like that, while it would be great to see him  turning all sorts of shades of red and white,  and it would be pretty boring. So instead of all that, I'm going to tell you about his life from my point of view&#xA;&#xA;John or is it Simon, I was never quite sure ,  was born in London, or was it Linton? Without a penny in his pocket and not a stitch on his back. Strange but true. Not a stitch. Her know, I understnd has a penny in his pocket and Christien supplies all the stiches . The nurse took on look at his puny pathetic little form, turned pale  and turned and slapped his mother. He was so ugly that other mothers would offer to hold her dear little monkey while she went to the loo/&#xA;&#xA;The family was so poor, so poor at the time, what with dad enjoying himself in the Army liberating the foreigners,  well it wasn't just him there was Chalky white, Spider Webb, Nobby Clarke and ooh, several others as well apparently, but that's by the by.. anyway Mum could afford any clothes for him at all, and only when dad came home on leave, he could lend John, or is it Simon? His army cap so he could look out of the window.&#xA;&#xA;Anyway things improved a lot for Simon or is it John when the first consignment of bananas of the war came in and mum got hold of one of these rare and precious objects ( don't ask how, the secret died with her, bless her). John/Simon took one bite and threw it to the floor in disgust. All was not lost however because mum carefully picked it up dried the skin and made him a lovely pair of mittens out of them.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;He was a poor sickly child- or so the Doctor said, and was therefore not allowed to go to a proper school like everyone else - you know , one with walls and a roof?  And instead went to the open air school for ill kids. However, Simon- or John - was made of sterner stuff and instead of dying of TB like the Doctor expected or hoped for, he came home each day.&#xA;&#xA;Anyway, When I came along he was five years older than me - and still is apparently - I inherited his banana skins mittens for a bit until he snatched it back, along with the rod from my crow shooting set  - over which I will say no more&#x2026;. For now&#x2026; to mend his projector with. &#xA;&#xA;He never did any of the stuff that older brothers are supposed to do with their younger brother. He never hit me, never kicked me, he never even gave me a proper Chinese burn. All my friends hated their brothers, but mine really let me down. Je was just too knd you see. That&#x2019;s why I have always forgiven him for the crow shooting set.&#xA;&#xA;Hang on, I remember my birthday party! I had Timothy Thorpe and Robert Bowen round for the traditional November 10th bangers and beans ( proper birthday nosh I had, none of your jelly and custard and poncey cake for me) and fireworks after.   &#xA;&#xA;John or Simon turned up with his geeky boffinny friend Haberhauer , and for some reason I cant put my finger on got busy stuffing bare wires into the electric socket with matchsticks. An electric iron and a car battery were involved as well.   I can confirm beans and bangers taste just as good in the dark, and the smell of burning was soon masked by the fireworks.&#xA;&#xA;I never had a watch. My brother had a watch, a nice pocket watch with a lovely chain. I never had a watch. I did have a crow shooting set for a while. But I never had a watch. If I wanted to know the time I would go to  the bedroom window and bang a big drum, until one of the neighbours shouted don&#x2019;t you know its three in the morning. Or I  would badger and badger John or Simon until he told me what the time was . One day he got really fed up with me asking and he gave me.. gave me! a lovely present so I didn&#x2019;t need to ask him the time ever again.He wrote the time down on this piece of paper.  I still have it. Its twenty past five.&#xA;&#xA;One day we decided we would build a clock between us. Do you remember that one Bro?  It was made out of old radio parts, motors, springs,  bits of bent metal, marbles and above all meccanno. But it wasn&#x2019;t a clock like anyone else had ever seen. Marbles ran down a sort of chute every minute and triggered  a finger ( or stuffed glove as  turned out ) to emerge from the depths of the machine, and turn over the next page  of a notebook where each minute was written in Biro. It actually worked sort of, and it sat in the cupboard outside the front bedroom for years, until it eventually got thrown out. &#xA;&#xA;I remember him in his capacity of projectionist at the Odeon embarrassing me mightily as Uncle John at Saturday morning pictures in a silly hat and moustache. Of course I denied knowing him. He also worked at Througoods making doughnuts but I never got any. Then he moved to Harlow just as Mum and Me and Kate moved into a caravan in Whitehall road&#xA;&#xA;He had all sorts of interesting brother-things too, like a musket which fired real balls, and he had all the right licences for. He kept it locked in the coal shed. I borrowed it for a prop in a play one day without asking him and I can remember coming back with it when the show was over and walking through the darkened streets at half past eleven at night  carrying it.  In those days a policeman would shine a torch into your face and ask what we were doing out so late, but fortunately no-one did on that occasion. ).  Now I would be shot dead for terrorism and carrying an offensive weapon. He was quite rightly furious when he found out and gave me that look that only he can.&#xA;&#xA;But that wasn&#x2019;t where it ended, he also had a starting pistol in the drawer in the hall that he didn&#x2019;t think I knew about. I found it and went all over the house clicking the trigger and shouting bang. ( it wasn&#x2019;t loaded&#x2026; ) Then I put it to my head  Russian Roulette style and pulled the trigger . There was one cartridge in the clip and it was that one.  The powder burns healed up quite nicely thank you but the trauma remains, and I have forgiven him for leaving a loaded gun in the house as well as the Crow set fiasco.&#xA;&#xA;Fast forward a good few years and we found ourselves together at Central School of Speech and Drama. He was on the acting course and I was on the technicians course. I wanted to be an actor too, but I didn&#x2019;t have the confidence.  Im not sure he wanted me there, I might have cramped his style a little, personally I never had any style to cramp, but I did have a good line in very smelly socks which led John or Simon  to speak sternly to me  &#x2013; from a distance with a peg on his nose.   He had a lot of interesting friends, including a couple of Swedish beauties, and a  real Bunny girl (bit raddled actually)  some of whom have gone on to greater things&#x2026;. The bastards&#x2026; I was a rubbish stage manager but quite a good con artist who has more or less managed to fool everyone all these years. He  on the other hand was very good actor. How well I remember him in his triumphant roles of Policeman no  7 in Z-cars.  Second Mourner in Death of a Window Cleaner,   Man in bed in &#x201c;The Sweet Sins of Sexy Susan&#x201d; man in bed in casualty, man in bed in Holby City, Man in pub in Eastenders and this is the biggie - Othello at Colchester Rep. Or was that my dad? I get confused.  He did play some really decent parts in some nice theatres including the West End and I was &#x2013; am - very proud of him.&#xA;&#xA;We also made a film, which was years ahead of its time, filming in Trafalgar Square at five in the morning. I carried a huge Polystyrene cross through the streets of Hampstead. It was called &#x201c;Alternatively not&#x201d; which in 1964 was pioneering use of the word alternative which became a buzzword, but no thanks to us. The film got lost. Shame, or you could all see for yourselves how bad, GOOD an actor he was.&#xA;&#xA;After college our paths crossed less often, but when they did it was always a laugh. Especially when I had to pretend on a trip to Colchester that Christine was my girlfriend not Simon or Johns .I never did find out why, but obviously I was crap at it, since she married him not me.  When they got married ( after a short whirlwind courtship of only twenty years or so) I couldn&#x2019;t be there, something I very much regret. On the other hand they came to all my weddings and didn&#x2019;t laugh even once . Not even when Aunt Kath shouted &#x201c;Call this a wedding?&#x201d;&#xA;&#xA;Later on we went into business together as Illuminati and had some great times losing money hand over fist but doing some excellent stuff, things we could really say were pioneering. The first real use of fibre optics for display purposes for example. We set up a production line in Brightlingsea to make and sell special bulbs, and there are some stories there,  We were genuinely known among the lighting companies as the best double act in the business. We had a simple technique. Make the customer laugh and try to get him to believe we knew what we were doing.  IF he turned out to be a miserable git who only called us in to steal our ideas, we would get our own back by stealing his pen. We had a variety of well rehearsed techniques for doing that. We would reach over and borrow it to make a note, then we would hold it in full view, tantalizingly waving it while talking about something else altogether and then openly, nonchalantly but forgetfully put it in our own top pocket. The customer never said anything. The trouble was we are far too similar, and while we had a lovely, lovely time swanning all over the map  in a variety of cheap and unreliable cars and genuinely being very very creative and original doing stuff of which we are , and Im sure I speak for him too, very very proud, but our lovely wives eventually convinced us that  eating and paying bills was a bit more important that we had imagined. So we regretfully parted ways as a business, but not, ever as brothers.&#xA;&#xA;Since then si-jo&#x2026;.  , look is in John or is it Simon? Lets get this straight for once and for all&#x2026;    Well which would you prefer? Ok then Simon, John it is.  ( writes it down on his watch-paper). Is that the time  twenty past five, my goodness. Better finish up quick)&#xA;&#xA;Since then we have been very enjoyably swapping ideas, projects , weird facts, scientific and philosophical theories day in day out.  &#xA;&#xA;Heres a typical phone call.&#xA;&#xA;How am I you ask? Well I must say &#x2028;I'll be fine as soon as this pain goes away&#x2028;&#xA;I'll be fine when I lose a few unwanted pounds &#x2028;and my cough isn't as bad as it sounds&#xA;The sight in my eye will return they say&#x2028; as soon as this pain in my head goes away&#xA;&#x2028;I guess I'll be able to hear again&#x2028;&#xA;but the doctor can't really tell me when&#xA;My teeth are ok all the bad ones fell out&#x2028;&#xA;And I could be walking if it weren't for the gout&#x2028;&#xA;but other than that I really feel fine&#x2028;&#xA;if only they'd fix this curve in my spine&#xA;How am I you ask well I'll tell you real quick&#xA;&#x2028;I was fine till you asked me but now I feel sick&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Happy Birthday Bro.. Oh by the way here is an official certificate of forgiveness for the stolen copper rod from my Crow Shooting set. I will never mention it again.  If you keep your nose clean that is."

Welcome Park is opening a new visitor center and Bunny and his friends want to get in on the act. They approach Park Ranger Ned with the idea that they could teach visitors about the seasons. Ned is worried because each has a bad habit that could interfere with each one doing their best work: Bunny rushes through things; Dog gets herself so nervous she can barely speak; Bee tries to do too many things at once. What will Ned and the audience decide about their readiness to work in the new visitor center?" Id="c159a83a27bed9f5fb94caf0f8de91ded2a5a20e"/>

  <videos Title="Powder Days: Thompson Pass Alaska part 6 - The final chapter" Description="Another bluebird day in Thompson pass, and more fresh pow to be slayed. Ben Starkey and I were getting pretty exhausted from multiple 6-9000' vertical days in a row, and we had another redemption run in store, RFS. We had got shut down earlier in the trip due to an impending storm that left us in a white out, seconds before we were ready to drop in. We decided to go get a second shot on the steep North facing slope. &#xA;&#xA;When we were approaching it, a familiar sound came thundering near Valdez Heli Ski Guides came and again dropped clients off on the summit, and on top of a skin track. This was a reoccurring theme while we were in Thompson pass. It really makes one wonder: with clients paying $200+ a run, wouldn't you think they would want to go somewhere farther than where you can skin to from the road? With thousands of acres of available terrain, and high paying clients, I see it as them just being too cheap to pay for the gas, and pilot time. We never had problems with any of the other heli operations. But on a consistent basic Valdez heli was dropping clients on top of skin tracks, and riding way smaller, and more mellow lines than we were. I can say without a doubt, that every time they landed around us, we had a way better run that cost us some calories, sweat, and anxiety due to these douchebags constantly dropping clients all around us. &#xA;&#xA;It was so bad that they literally dropped clients on the top of RFS and didn't ride down the steep North face, but rode down the mellow East face and directly on top of a skin track! Then to top it off while we were on the summit, they dropped a group at the base to ride basically a bunny run. It was so flat, that their clients were getting stuck, on what looked to be a snow bridge on top of a crevasse! Every time we would  see them, we would heckle, give them the one finger solute, and others thought it was best just to moon them. Anyways enough with the gapers...&#xA;&#xA;We rode down RFS and debated going for another lap, or heading over to the East face of python, but we were drained, both mentally and physically. We decided to blow our wads on some world class GFP, dry our gear, eat a real lunch, and relax. This would be our last run in Alaska for the season.&#xA;&#xA;Coming to Alaska for the first time, with hopes of riding the lines of our lives, Thompson pass delivered. I will never look at snowboarding the same. Alaska truly is a magical place, and should be on every snow sliders bucket list. Although once you go, you'll never going to be able to stop wanting to go back.&#xA;&#xA;Until next year..." Id="94a4508fa82db3cde72f573bf3bf833c8339b51d"/>

Mixing the seductive glamor of film noir with the raw energy of John Woo's A Better Tomorrow, The Killing Game is a ride that keeps you guessing until the final twist.&#xA;&#xA;Max&#x662f;&#x4e00;&#x4f4d;&#x8eab;&#x624b;&#x77eb;&#x6377;&#x7684;&#x9876;&#x5c16;&#x6740;&#x624b;&#x3002;&#x4e3a;&#x6b63;&#x4e49;&#x800c;&#x884c;&#x52a8;&#x7684;&#x4ed6;&#xff0c;&#x88ab;&#x6076;&#x4eba;&#x60e7;&#x6015;&#xff0c;&#x53d7;&#x5973;&#x4eba;&#x7231;&#x6155;&#x3002;&#x4ed6;&#x8fd9;&#x6b21;&#x884c;&#x52a8;&#x7684;&#x76ee;&#x6807;&#x662f;&#x523a;&#x6740;&#x57ce;&#x4e2d;&#x7684;&#x9ed1;&#x5e2e;&#x8001;&#x5927;&#x3002;&#x5728;&#x4ed6;&#x770b;&#x6765;&#xff0c;&#x8fd9;&#x5e76;&#x4e0d;&#x662f;&#x96be;&#x4e8b;&#x3002;&#x53ef;&#x4e8b;&#x60c5;&#x80cc;&#x540e;&#x7684;&#x771f;&#x76f8;&#x5f80;&#x5f80;&#x4e0d;&#x6613;&#x53d1;&#x6398;&#x3002;&#xA;&#xA;&#x300a;&#x6211;&#x662f;&#x6740;&#x624b;&#x300b;&#x662f;&#x4e00;&#x90e8;&#x7206;&#x7b11;&#x9ed1;&#x5e2e;&#x7c7b;&#x578b;&#x7247;&#xff0c;&#x7531;&#x300a;&#x5154;&#x5973;&#x90ce;&#x7684;&#x60f3;&#x5165;&#x975e;&#x975e;&#x300b;&#x548c;&#x300a;&#x795e;&#x91c7;&#x98de;&#x626c;&#x300b;&#x83b7;&#x5956;&#x56e2;&#x961f;&#x503e;&#x60c5;&#x5448;&#x73b0;&#x3002;&#x6697;&#x9ed1;&#x559c;&#x5267;&#x98ce;&#x683c;&#x6df7;&#x5408;&#x7740;&#x5411;&#x5434;&#x5b87;&#x68ee;&#x300a;&#x82f1;&#x96c4;&#x672c;&#x8272;&#x300b;&#x7684;&#x81f4;&#x656c;&#x5143;&#x7d20;&#xff0c;&#x300a;&#x6211;&#x662f;&#x6740;&#x624b;&#x300b;&#x5e26;&#x4f60;&#x4f53;&#x9a8c;&#x60ac;&#x5ff5;&#x8fed;&#x8d77;&#x7684;&#x6740;&#x624b;&#x4e4b;&#x65c5;&#x3002;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;info@lpfilms.net&#xA;luotong@lpfilms.net" Id="794762658fbbd72c30b0e2e4c4056f9717da3e47"/>
